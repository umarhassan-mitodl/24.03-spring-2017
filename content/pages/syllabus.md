Course Description
------------------

Our choices about what to eat are expressive of different sorts of value. Some choices are expressive of our _aesthetic_ values: they concern which foods are or are not tasty, appealing, delicious, revolting, etc. Some choices are expressive of our _moral_ values: which foods we are morally permitted to eat; which kinds of food production are permissible, or not, due to forms of labor required, and the environmental impact, or health implications. Some food choices are expressive of our _cultural or religious_ values: which foods are culturally or religiously required or forbidden, which are high- or low-status, etc. All of these sorts of values are tremendously important to the ways we live our lives.

In considering our food choices, we will discuss several specific moral issues:

*   What sorts of moral obligations, if any, do we have toward non-human animals?
*   How are our personal choices e.g., about what to eat, related to global justice?
*   What is the state's responsibility to provide reliable information to consumers?
*   Are we each individually morally required to take action to reduce global warming?

We'll look at questions both about _individual food choices_ and about _food policy_ — at questions both about what we should, as individuals, decide to eat, and what actions we, as a society, ought to take in order to influence how our food is grown, processed, marketed, sold and consumed.

Course Objectives
-----------------

The course is designed to improve students' ability to

*   Identify moral and political issues and interpret arguments relevant to food choices and policies.
*   Gather and evaluate information relevant to these issues.
*   Become familiar with normative frameworks for making moral decisions, and apply them to food choices and policies.
*   Develop a more sophisticated moral perspective on their own food choices.
*   Communicate information and engage in moral discussions about controversial topics.

Requirements
------------

Reading, discussing, and writing about the assigned readings are the central activities of this class. There is a reading assignment for each lecture. Some are quite difficult and demand careful study. You should complete the assigned readings _before_ each lecture, as the lecture will often resuppose familiarity with the material in the texts.
